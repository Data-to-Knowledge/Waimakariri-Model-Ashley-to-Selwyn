The python environment is the set of libraries used to interpret and run scripts.
In the past the python environment for the Waimakariri Model has been somewhat unstable.
In order to combat this I have put together an Anaconda YML file, which lists all of the dependencies
and should be able to load the environment for the foreseeable future. The biggest difficulty in
maintaining/updating the environment is the current flopy instance This has been copied into
these scripts as flopy_mh as a number of edits were needed in order to fix bugs in the package and
there was not time in our process to undergo a pull request.  Unfortunately this requires numpy 1.13.

In order to install the environment:

1) download miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2) open the anaconda prompt and enter:
        conda env create -f {path to environment.yml}
3) the yml referenced here is: ...\python_env\waimak_model_environment.yml

In addition I have made a copy of the python environment in ...\python_env\Miniconda2.
This folder can be copied to the local drive in order to be useful. This is not the best option for
 creating and using the python environment but it is included here to provide additional redundancy
 in this key step.  This was made on a windows 10 machine.

If you are to use this pre-prepared python environment:
1) move it to a high speed local drive (otherwise it is painfully slow)
2) the interpreter you want is ..\Miniconda2\envs\waimak_model\python.exe
