In the past the python environment has been somewhat unstables.  in order to combat this I have put togeather an
Anaconda YML file, which lists all of the dependencies and should be able to load the environment for the foreseeable
future. The biggest difficulty if maintaining the current flopy instance, which has been coppied into these scripts as
flopy_mh as a number of edits were needed in order to fix bugs in the package.  unfortunately this requires numpy 1.13

In order to install the environment:

1) download miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
2) open the anaconda prompt and enter:
        conda env create -f {path to environment.yml} # note exclude the {} and just enter the path
3) the yml referenced here is the waimak_model_environment.yml in this folder.
